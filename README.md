Hello fellow Tech enthusiasts!!!. This is a repository that explains the common practices and advanced javascript concepts

### Why are closures useful in JavaScript?

### [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures#creating_closures_in_loops_a_common_mistake) :

Closures in JavaScript are a powerful concept where an inner function retains access to variables from its outer functionâ€™s scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. This means that a function "remembers" the environment in which it was created.

Closure is a feature available in Java Script which enables a function to access a variable outside it's lexical scope even after the entity or function enclosing the function that is trying to access the variable has finished execution and has returned. In simple words, a closure gives you access to outer function's scope from inner function.


### How Closures Work:
When a function is declared inside another function, the inner function can access the variables defined in the outer function, even after the outer function has returned. This happens because of JavaScriptâ€™s function scope and its behavior of keeping references to variables in its environment, creating what is called a closure.

### Key Aspects of Closures:
* Lexical Scoping: The inner function has access to variables in three levels of scope:
* Variables in its own scope
* Variables in the outer functionâ€™s scope
* Global variables
* Persistent Data: Since the inner function keeps access to the outer functionâ€™s scope, the outer functionâ€™s variables are not discarded 
  when the outer function finishes. This allows the inner function to "close over" these variables, hence the term "closure."

Closure Example:
```js
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log('Outer Variable:', outerVariable);
    console.log('Inner Variable:', innerVariable);
  };
}

const closureExample = outerFunction('outside');
closureExample('inside'); 
```

In this example:

outerFunction creates a closure by returning innerFunction.
Even after outerFunction finishes, innerFunction can still access outerVariable because of the closure.

## Use Cases:
ðŸŽ¯ **_Data Privacy/Encapsulation:_**  Closures are often used to create private variables that canâ€™t be accessed directly from the outside.
```js
//function to explain Data Privacy through closures
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0; // This is a private variable

  return {
    increment: () => {
      count++;
      return count;
    },
    decrement: () => {
      count--;
      return count;
    },
    getCount: () => {
      return count;
    },
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();

console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
console.log(counter.increment()); // 2
console.log(counter.decrement()); // 1
console.log(counter.getCount()); // 1
```
ðŸŽ¯ **_Function Factories:_** Closures allow you to create function factories, which return functions customized by their environment.
```js
function createMultiplier(multiplier) {
  return function(value) {
    return value * multiplier;
  };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
const triple = createMultiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // 10
console.log(triple(5)); // 1
```
ðŸŽ¯ **_Callbacks and Event Listeners:_** Closures are commonly used in asynchronous code such as callbacks, event listeners, and promises.
```js
function fetchData(url) {
  let data = 'Data from ' + url;
  return function() {
    console.log(data);
  };
}

const displayData = fetchData('https://example.com');
displayData(); // Logs 'Data from https://example.com'
```
ðŸŽ¯ **_Maintainining State:_** closures are also useful in maintaining state between function calls without using global variables. This is particularly useful in scenarios when we need to cache cost expensive function calls.

```js
//Function to explain memorization and state maintenance using closures
function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = {};

  return function (...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key]) {
      return cache[key];
    }
    const result = fn(...args);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  };
}

function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

const memoizedFibonacci = memoize(fibonacci);

console.log(memoizedFibonacci(10)); // 55
console.log(memoizedFibonacci(10)); // 55 (retrieved from cache)
console.log(memoizedFibonacci(20)); // 6765
console.log(memoizedFibonacci(20)); // 6765 (retrieved from cache)
```
